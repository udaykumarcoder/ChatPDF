# ChatWithPDF RAG

ChatWithPDF is an interactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to query and interact with the contents of PDF documents using advanced language models. The system allows for seamless extraction of text from PDFs and provides a  interface that allows users to ask questions and receive relevant answers based on the document's content.

The web interface is designed to be responsive and clean, offering a user-friendly experience with easy navigation and interaction. The system leverages modern techniques like vector embeddings and retrieval-based models to quickly process user queries and provide insightful responses.

## Features

* **PDF Text Extraction**: Automatically extract text from uploaded PDF documents for querying.
* **Clean User Interface**: Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, offering a responsive and intuitive user experience.
* **Fast and Accurate Retrieval**: Using vector embeddings for fast and efficient document retrieval to answer queries accurately.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatWithPDF.git
   cd ChatWithPDF
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the necessary dependencies for the application:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   Start the application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will launch the web app locally on `http://localhost:8501`.

4. **Upload a PDF**
   Upload a PDF file to begin interacting with the content. The system will automatically extract the text and make it ready for querying.

5. **Ask Questions**
   Once the PDF is uploaded, you can ask questions about its content. The system will process your query and provide relevant responses based on the document.
